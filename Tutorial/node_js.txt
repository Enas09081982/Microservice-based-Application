JavaScript

One of must popular language , 
Jobs:
Front-end Developer
Back-end Developer
Full-stack Developer

can used in browser, 
by using it we can build :
Web/mobile App ,
Real-time Networking Apps
Command Line Tool
Games

The code is run in browser, where every browser has java script engine that can execute java script code .
In FireFox the JavaScript engin is (SpiderMonkey)
In Chrome the JavaScript engin is (v8) 
In Explorer the JavaScript engin is (Chakra)

JavaScript can be run in browser or Node ( V8 embedded in c++)
So Node is A runtime environment for executing javaScript code and it asynchronous by default where each thread can deal with multi request . And it just use with data intensive and real time applications
not cpu intensive

ECMAScript vs JavaScript

ECMAScript is just specification and responsible to define standards while the other is language

Write your first JavaScript code:
Open Chrome browser, right_click --→Aspect--→console---→console.log(‘hellowold’);

Setting up JavaScript Environment:
VS code
OR Sublime Text
OR Atom
And we need Node to set up some of lib we need later.

We will use VS code: 
Make New Folder and Open it with VS code . 
Create New index.html
type ! Then press Tab, that will generate basic form of html
Go to install live server from extension then restart VS Code , after open go to index.html right click --→ open with live server 

Type between <body></body> 
h1 then press TAB 
<h1>Hello World!</h1> 
then open again from live server you will see your changes 
it’s better to put JavaScript code before the end of body section 



<javascript>
console.log(‘HEllo World!’);
</javascript>


OR create another file and called it index.js

then inside <javascript src=’index.js’>

now we can create our variable like :

let name=’inas’;

or let name={

myName:’inas’,
age:41
};

console.log(name);


If we have a list of color that a user maybe use it or a list of product then we have to use array :: 
let selectedColor = [‘red’,’blue’];
console.log(selectedColor);

console.log(selectedColor);
console.log(selectedColor.length);


Functions::

function greeting(name){  // parameter
console.log('hello'+name)
}

greeting('Inas');// Argument



function square(num){
return num*num;
}

console.log(square(5));
***************************************
Node:::::

To execute javascript code:

we open terminal and type: 
node javascript_file

Node module system 

Loading a Module in javascript 

index.js:


function log(messages){
console.log(messages);
}
module.exports.log = log;




add.js::

const logg = require('./index');

logg.log(‘message’);
